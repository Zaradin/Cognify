Cognify is a cloud-based AI system developed as a University Final Year Project. It utilises deep learning techniques to analyse MRI images and detect signs of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). This web application enables users to log in, create patient profiles, and upload MRI session scans. Users can attach notes, apply trained models to generate predictions, and compare MRI images from different timeframes, assisting in the diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer’s Disease.
